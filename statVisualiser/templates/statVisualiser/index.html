            Welcome to stats n stuff, a webapp which allows you to visualise some basic statistical distributions:

        <h2>Distributions</h2>

        <p>
            On this page, you can visualise the probability functions of some distributions, and view the convolution of two random variables.
            You can specify whether the convolution is a sum or product of the two random variables. You can view the joint probability functions, and an approximation of the supported region.

        <h2>The Law of Large Numbers</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            A demonstration of applying the law of large numbers to the binomial distribution. The demonstrations include
            the normal approximation, and the poisson approximation (the law of rare events).

        <h2>Generate Dataset</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Lets you generate your own dataset based on your choice of distributions. This can then be downloaded in a csv format for your own use.
            You can generate up to 2 variables, with an option to view the joint histogram of the two variables.

        <title> Glossary of figures available</title>
        <ul>
        <li>PMF: Probability Mass Function. A function for discrete variables that returns the probability of a given event occurring.</li>
        <li>PDF: Probability Density Function. This is analogous to the PMF for continuous variables. Note it indicates the probability density, not the probability of a given outcome.</li>
        <li>CDF: Cumulative Density Function. This returns the cumulative probability for a given input i.e. the probability the variable will be less than the input value.
        <p>For the discrete case, the CDF function sums over all values of the PMF up to the input. For the continuous case, it integrates the variable's PDF over the region to the input value.
        </p></li>
        <li>Supported region: Shows the values a given distribution can occupy with a non-zero probability.</li>
        <li>Joint Probability Functions: The multidimensional case of the PDF and CDF. This website supports up to 2 independent variables. The PDF is a product of each variable's PMF/PDF.</li>
        </ul>
